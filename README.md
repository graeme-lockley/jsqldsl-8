jsqldsl-8
=========

An SQL DSL grounded in DRY and strong typing.

I am suspending this project and breaking it up into individual projects with each one being pushed separately.  The reason for this is because this project is covering multiple concerns and, schemadoc, one of the subprojects is useful independent of the rest of the main project.
